# Final_project_Webshop_MERN_2021 Technigo Bootcamp 20/21



Webshop built with the MERN stack aka Node.js, React, Redux, Express, MongoDB.

Other tech used:

* React-Router
* Bootstrap
* Cloudinary
* Postman
* MongoDB compass
* Heroku
* Restful API
* Stack Overflow
* Slack

I wanted to build a full-scale webshop using the MERN stack. I wanted to experience working in a large-scale code base. Putting together my own backend, my API and being able to modify my own data and connect it to my frontend was my main focus. The ambition was high, in the end both time limits and various technical challenges inevitably affected the result but I'm happy with what I've been up to so far. The goal has been to dare, test and learn along the way ..... that there was a dummy webshop as an end result is just a bonus! There have been many "first time I test this moments" in this project. A big learning goal has been both to anchor previous knowledge but also test new stuff. The experience of trying things out was my main goal. There is a lot of code that has not been used yet, but which may be fully implemented later, there is always a window for further development open .....
